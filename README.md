# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a rock, paper scissors game developed by me for my college project. The code in python uses import function like random. The computer will randomly generate between rock, paper and scissors. We must choose first and the winner gets the point.
**Basics**
1. The user selects one option:
rock
paper
scissors
2. The computer randomly selects its option.
3. The winner is decided based on these rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
4. The game displays:
User choice
Computer choice
**Result (Win / Lose / Draw)**
**INSIGHTS**
 User vs Computer gameplay
 Randomized computer moves
 Simple and interactive interface
 Can exit anytime using quit
 Beginner-friendly project
Rock–Paper–Scissors – README
**Overview**
Rock–Paper–Scissors is a simple interactive game where a user competes against the computer. This project demonstrates core programming concepts including conditional logic, randomization, user input handling, and modular code design. It can be used for learning, portfolio building, or small-scale deployment.
**Features**
Interactive user gameplay
Computer-generated moves using randomness
Automatic winner evaluation
Scoreboard tracking
Error handling for invalid inputs
Clean, modular code structure for easy extension
How the Game Works
The game follows the traditional rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Players make a selection, the computer makes a random selection, and the winner is determined based on predefined logic.
Tech Stack
**Language: Python / JavaScript / (Specify your language)**
Dependencies: None (unless your version uses external libraries)
**Usage**
When the game starts:
1. The system prompts you to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer generates its own random choice.
3. The program displays:
**Both choices**
**The round result (win/lose/draw)**
Updated scores
You can continue playing until you decide to exit.
**Extending the Game**
You can scale the project further by integrating:
Graphical UI (Tkinter, Pygame, HTML/CSS/JS)
Multiplayer mode
Best-of-3/5/7 match settings
Mobile-responsive web version
Sound effects and animations
